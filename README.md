Template to deploy microservice to kubernetes


TODO:


### Design

#### App
This repo should be a showcase to deploy Backstage to either Heroku or Digital Ocean. 
    - should support multiple environments prod/staging/dev -> deployment for each PR
    - each deployment should have full functionality -> GitHub integration & authentication
    - Backstage itself should be pretty bare, we just want to run showcase templates

#### Templates
Template to deploy simple Hello World python microservice to AWS, GCP or Azure. User should have minimal necessary choice input, basically just select cloud. Outcome should be new repository with working CI/CD and live endpoint for helloworld
