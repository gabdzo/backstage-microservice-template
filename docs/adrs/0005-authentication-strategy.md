# Use Multi-provider OAuth2 for Authentication

## Context and Problem Statement

How should we implement authentication in our Backstage deployment?
How can we ensure secure access while supporting multiple authentication providers?

## Considered Options

* Multi-provider OAuth2
* Single Sign-On (SSO)
* Custom auth solution
* Basic authentication

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Multi-provider OAuth2", because it provides the best balance of security, flexibility, and integration capabilities.

### Positive Consequences

* Support for multiple auth providers
* Secure token-based authentication
* Integration with existing systems
* Fine-grained access control
* Standard OAuth2 flows

### Negative Consequences

* Complex configuration
* Multiple auth flows to maintain
* Token management overhead
* Additional security considerations

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Multi-provider OAuth2

* Good, because it supports multiple providers
* Good, because it's a standard protocol
* Good, because it's secure by design
* Good, because it's widely supported
* Bad, because it's complex to configure
* Bad, because it requires token management

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

* Good, because it provides unified login
* Good, because it reduces password fatigue
* Bad, because it's tied to one provider
* Bad, because it has limited flexibility
* Bad, because it may require additional licensing

### Custom Auth Solution

* Good, because it can be tailored to needs
* Good, because it provides full control
* Bad, because it requires development effort
* Bad, because it needs security auditing
* Bad, because it lacks standard compliance

### Basic Authentication

* Good, because it's simple to implement
* Good, because it's easy to understand
* Bad, because it's less secure
* Bad, because it lacks modern features
* Bad, because it has poor user experience
