# 5. Authentication Strategy

Date: 2024-03-20

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We needed an authentication solution that:
- Supports multiple auth providers
- Integrates with existing systems
- Provides role-based access
- Secures backend services

## Decision
We implemented a multi-provider authentication strategy using:
- OAuth2 for user authentication
- JWT for session management
- Role-based access control
- Service-to-service auth with tokens

## Consequences
### Positive
- Flexible auth options
- Secure service access
- Fine-grained permissions
- SSO capabilities

### Negative
- Complex configuration
- Token management overhead
- Multiple auth flows to maintain
