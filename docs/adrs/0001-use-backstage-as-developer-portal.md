# 1. Use Backstage as Developer Portal

Date: 2024-03-20

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We needed a centralized developer portal solution that could:
- Provide service catalog capabilities
- Support documentation-as-code
- Enable custom plugin development
- Offer scaffolding capabilities
- Integrate with existing tools

## Decision
We decided to use Backstage as our developer portal platform because:
- It's open source and backed by Spotify
- Has a growing ecosystem of plugins
- Supports custom plugin development
- Uses modern tech stack (React, Node.js, TypeScript)
- Has strong community support

## Consequences
### Positive
- Unified developer experience
- Standardized service documentation
- Reduced time to bootstrap new services
- Extensible plugin architecture

### Negative
- Learning curve for new developers
- Need to maintain Backstage infrastructure
- Required investment in custom plugin development
